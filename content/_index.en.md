## Software developer with a passion for graphics programming
---

Welcome to my website.

My name is **Hamza NANAHA**, I'm **20** years old and I'm a **student** in my 2nd year of BUT **Informatique** in Toulouse.

**Developer by passion**, **Linux** user.
I like to create programmes that make it easier for me to use my PC
and make me more **productive** as a developer.

I have a **passion** for **graphic programming**,
displaying beautiful **interactive** images on a screen is something that technically interests me enormously.
Creating little **video games** is definitely one of my **goals**.

On this website, you will discover my past and current [projects](project/) with **examples** and **demos**,
the [games](game/) I've created.

I like to take on projects and ideas that come to mind
and see how far I can take them.
That's why I'm **autonomous** and **self-taught**.
because I had to learn a lot on my own.

However, I have a good **team spirit**
because I participated in a lot of group projects during my studies, internships and work-study programs,
so I'm able to **adapt** to different work environments quickly.
